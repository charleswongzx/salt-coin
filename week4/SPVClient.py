"""
Design and implement an `SPVClient` class.  SPV clients should implement a
simple SPV logic, i.e., they should:
- have their key pairs associated
- be able to receive block headers (not full blocks)
- be able to receive transactions (with their presence proofs) and verify them
- be able to send transactions
f
Integrate your implementation with your simulator from the previous exercise.
Test your implementation.
