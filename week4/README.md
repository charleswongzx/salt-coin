# BLOCKCHAIN PROJECT
Basic implementation of Blockchain

## Getting Started
1. Download git repo
2. In CLI, run main.py file, this implements all the blockchain functions
```
$ python main.py
```
You should get this result:

![Mining and Verification](imgs/main_output.png)
![Blocks](imgs/main_blocks.png)
![Blocks](imgs/Balance_Checks.png)


3.In CLI, run main_attack.py file, this implements the selfish mining attacks
```
$ python main_attack.py
```
You should get this result:

![Blocks](imgs/attack_balance.png)

## Class Functions:
Transaction class:
  - validate: Returns True/ False to whether the transaction is valid (signed by sender)
  - sign: Signs the json message
  - to_json: Converts to a json message

Block class:
  - mineBlock: Proof of Work
  - calculateHash: Calculate a block's hash  
  - proof_tree: Returns a merkle path for a specified transaction, for proving in SPVclient
  - build_tree: Builds merkle tree from transactions.

Blockchain class:
  - createGenesisBlock: Creates a Genesis block
  - getLatestBlock: Gets the most recent block from the blockchain
  - checkvalidblock: Check the hash of the most recent block in chain is the same as the mined block's previous hash. Based on fork status the block will be added to create a fork in the chain
  - add: Checks if there is a fork in the chain and resolves it. After validation, it adds the block into the chain and rewards the miner
  - resolve: When there is a fork, resolve is called to resolve the chain by selecting the longest chain.


Miner class:
  - mine: Function to mine which mines the block and and updates the ledger and pushes changed to the chain
  - selfish_mine: Function to selfish mine which mines the block while not broadcasting the changes to the chain and only broadcasting the changes after mining a block first
  - update: Update function is suppose to simulate a broadcast function in a network. As they was no network we simulated the network broadcast functionality by calling it after a successful block mine.
  - send_transaction: Miners should have the ability to send money to other miners or clients
  - verifyTransaction: Verify Pending Transactions and add into list of verifiedTransactions
  - updateLedger: Updates address-balance ledger after sucessfuly mining block    
  - getChainLedger: When a new miner is added or a resolve happens on the chain. It calculates the record ledger of the chain and check record ledger dictionary if key of sender & receiver public key exist
  - chainvalidation: Validation of Chain's Hash, Checks every time we mine a block
  - getpath: Returns a merkle path for a specified transaction


SPV class:
  - get_block_header: Return all block headers from chain
  - receive_transaction: Proof Transacation exist in block
  - send_transaction: Sends a signed transaction


## Differences between Bitcoin and your SUTDcoin:
  1. Decentralise
    
    In Bitcoin, everything is decentralised.
    But for our implementation of SUTDcoin, due to constraints of network, we were not able to make it decentralised.
    e.g. Our pool of transactions is a centralised pool.
  
  2. Difficulty
    
    In Bitcoin, diificulty changes over time, whereas SUTDCoin has fixed difficulty
    
  3. Number of Miners
